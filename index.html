          <h1>Seeking Classical Broadcasters</h1>
        <p><br>Do you have a love of classical music and knowledge to go with it? Do you have the personality to share your passion with others and a bit of technical aptitude? Call the station at 203-268-9667 so Jane Stadler, Operations Director, can tell you about 
            the broadcaster audition process.
            <br><br>
             
            Q: I am a listener, why are you inviting me to be a broadcaster?!  
            <br>
            A: Most of our broadcasters were listeners before they were broadcasters!
            <br><br>
            
             “I have listened to WMNR since its inception as a classical music station in 1982. As a lifelong classical music devotee, I particularly responded to the tastes of some of the broadcasters who I knew got to choose their programs and strayed from the usual top 50 format of other stations. As I faced retirement as a practicing physician, I was looking to pursue something else besides medicine to keep my mind active. I called Kurt and asked if he had an opening. Indeed he did. It has been a great experience. The staff is friendly and supportive. I have learned to be passable on-air; it was a struggle at first. I have had to learn broadcasting technology at the station and new applications of my home computers to download musical material, edit it and sometimes record it...ALL GOOD! Best of all, I have had to listen to a lot of wonderful new music in order to build programs with variety. If you enjoy classical music, the opportunity to share it with others shouldn't be missed.”
